She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole\'s father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents\' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole\'s first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001005?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Jane Campion</a> (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time.

After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101898?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Flirting</a> (1991), then as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dustin Hoffman</a>\'s moll in the gangster flick <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101453?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Billy Bathgate</a> (1991).

Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady.

As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics\' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001005?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Jane Campion</a>, on the adaptation of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416556?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Henry James</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117364?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Portrait of a Lady</a> (1996).

The couple\'s on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise\'s homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman.

She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts.

His family was of Mexican descent. If Olmos had followed the first love of his life, he would have been a professional baseball player. But by age 13, another love entered his life: rock music. By age 15, he was already an experienced rock singer, forming and reforming several \"garage bands\" along the way. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he played the most famous clubs on Sunset Strip, including Gazzarri\'s and The Factory. But a friend suggested that, with his flair for the dramatic, he consider a career in acting. Throughout the 1970s, he divided his time between rock music gigs, acting classes, bit parts in television, Off-off-off Broadway plays and his business of moving fine furniture (which kept body, soul and family together). His first big break was a starring role in Luis Valdez\'s play, \"Zoot Suit\", in 1978.

But acting, directing and screenwriting are only parts of what he does. Olmos contends he would much rather be known as an activist than an actor. He devotes much of his time to causes, particularly those focusing on the needs and rights of children. He makes, on average, some 150 personal appearances a year to places where he can reach kids at risk; juvenile halls, detention centers, boys/girls clubs, schools. Anywhere he can get across his message that \"we all have a choice\" about where life takes us.<br><br>Olmos stresses the importance of education, the risks of gang life and tries to promote the notion of taking responsibility for one\'s own actions and one\'s own happiness in life.

After finishing high school, he decided to become a lawyer and majored at University of Santander, one of the most prestigious universities in Europe.That wouldn\'t last long either, because he got the acting bug by chance when attended an acting class alongside a friend that wanted to be an actress, he was invited to participate and enjoyed it enough to do that for living. At 19, he relocated to Madrid to start his drama classes at the R.E.S.A.D. (Madrid Acting Conservatory) and tried to continue with Law School attending the U.N.E.D. (a college where people can study even if they live far away), but due to the time the acting classes demanded him, couldn\'t focus on his other career and quit after passing the first signature.

He is the son of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852983?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Patricia Taylor</a>, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu\'s mother is originally from England. After his parents\' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716238?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Kim Reeves</a>, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007477?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Paul Aaron</a>, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.<br><br>After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rob Lowe</a> hockey flick <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092272?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Youngblood</a> (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics\' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">River\'s Edge</a> (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> (1988) with director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Stephen Frears</a>.<br><br>His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude \"Ted Logan\" in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Bill &amp; Ted\'s Excellent Adventure</a> (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Ron Howard</a>\'s comedy, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098067?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Parenthood</a> (1989) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001410?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lawrence Kasdan</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099819?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">I Love You to Death</a> (1990).<br><br>Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects.

Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116289?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Feeling Minnesota</a> (1996) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119502?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Last Time I Committed Suicide</a> (1997), and big films like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Walk in the Clouds</a> (1995) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Devil\'s Advocate</a> (1997).

In 2009, Emily\'s venture into television began when she became a popular face, recurring as \'Emily Gardener\' on the ABC series \"Eastwick\" and on the daytime drama \"All My Children\" as \'Emma Lavery.\' She continued to be seen on hit television series such as \"Medium,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Hawaii 5-O,\" \"Suburgatory,\" Lifetime\'s \"Who is Clark Rockefeller?\", and \"Sundays at Tiffany\'s.\" She is also widely known for the ABC hit series, \"Revenge,\" playing \'Young Amanda Clarke.\' In 2011, Emily was given the amazing opportunity to play Shirley Temple in Clint Eastwood\'s \"J.

Following, Emily starred in the movie musical \"Dear Dumb Diary,\" playing the lead role of \'Jamie Kelly,\' based on the popular children\'s book series.

Born to working singer/songwriters, she came into this world as part of the music industry.

Tiffany learned budgets while she was still in elementary school and completed her first actual business plan at the age of 8. She participated in to her first marketing and PR meeting at the age of 12. Tiffany was then given the reins of an aspect of one of Chuck\'s many businesses before her 13th birthday. Tiffany is a classically trained ballerina, which, from a young age, taught her poise under pressure, stamina, grace, structure and an incredible work ethic. However, Tiffany learned she did not like the bright lights of the stage or the spotlight that accompanied it. She found herself consistently drawn to the business aspects of making things work. She took a job at KLAC, producing the LA Lakers radio show and simultaneously working in their marketing and PR departments. She received her first press pass at age 18, contributing to campaigns such as Pepsi Clear with Magic Johnson. Always insatiable, Tiffany decided to venture out and establish her own company. Her first success was in wedding and party planning and coordination. What started out simply and locally soon became a well-established, high-end business, attracting clients from all sides of the spectrum and financial base. An outside company took notice of her enterprise and invested in Tiffany, her knowledge and the business. She continued moving forward, expanding the company into its own, complete, full-service enterprise. There was no longer a need to outsource any of the work. Like every good start-up leader, she ultimately sold it to a much larger organization. After having her son, Spencer, an international corporation contacted Tiffany enlisting her help mending their public relations and publicity. She stepped in, and soon had garnered the name, \"the fixer\". At this point, she was working as an independent contractor. Realizing the depth and breadth of her skills, the firm offered her a position within their organization, planning and coordinating all of their promotional events. The global nature the firm afforded Tiffany the opportunity to acquire knowledge of new and diverse business practices. After a short time, she was given a company within the company, which she ran for many years. Before joining Visual Arts Entertainment, Tiffany was a consultant in marketing, PR, management, HR and finance for a multitude of organizations both inside and outside the entertainment and music industry.

Merritt begged her parents to travel to L.A. soon after \'Silent Tongue\' wrapped, but they both agreed that she needed to have a childhood, and a real life first. From that moment forward, Merritt took part in anything that had to do with acting. She vigorously sought out classes, community theatre, high school theatre, independent films, and eventually a college degree in Performing Arts. After graduating college as magna cum laude, Merritt went to Portland, Oregon to try on a different market in acting. With many successes in community and professional theatre (including one of her favorite roles, The Wicked Witch of the West), Merritt spent three years away from her home state. When asked what brought her back to New Mexico, Merritt states with a grin: \"The pilot of \'Breaking Bad\'....I was watching it in Portland and going, what the hell are you doing Merritt?! This is HUGE and it\'s going on right in your backyard! I knew I had to make it back to New Mexico to try and become a part of this incredible show in some way. They were revolutionizing television, and I had just moved away.\" Shortly after seeing the pilot, Glover moved back to Albuquerque, New Mexico to start her pursuit of a film career in addition to her theatrical career. Two years later, Merritt booked her first SAG speaking role on the popular series: \'In Plain Sight,\' as Sheila. Soon to follow was another role on the well received show: \'Longmire\' as the Receptionist. Then, after around twenty auditions for \'Breaking Bad,\' as well as a two year stint as Skylar\'s (Anna Gunn\'s) stand-in, Merritt got the call: she had finally booked a role on the series that brought her back to New Mexico. Following this huge dream come true on \'Breaking Bad,\' Merritt can be seen in the critically acclaimed series \'Manhattan,\' as the Wind Chime Woman, along with the film: \'The Condemned 2\' as the Deputy. Independent credits include Verna, in the feature length horror \'Rotgut,\' Camille in the feature length romantic comedy \'Missing You,\' and the Clerk in the upcoming comedy short: \'Death By Crickets.\' With over 34 theatrical credits, and 18+ film and television credits under her belt, Merritt will keep going.<br>\n         ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'3839545','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMWQzMGEtYmRmYy00YTVhLTg5YTktNmRhN2MyMGZmNjYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY317_CR20,0,214,317_AL_.jpg',1545843479),(414,'Christopher Hagen',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2474652','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTgxMDkwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4OTI2NDE@._V1_UY317_CR20,0,214,317_AL_.jpg',1545843479),(415,'Luis Bordonada',NULL,'Luis Bordonada is an American actor who joined the Army after graduating High School.

This was around the same time her equally political brother Corin introduced her to the Workers Revolutionary Party, a group who aimed to destroy capitalism and abolish the monarchy. Her film career began to suffer and take the back seat as she became more involved with the party, twice unsuccessfully attempting to run as a party member for parliament, only obtaining a very small percentage of votes.<br><br>In terms of her film career at the time, she was given probably the smallest part in the huge ensemble who-dunnit hit, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071877?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Murder on the Orient Express</a> (1974) and given another thankless small part as Lola Deveraux in the Sherlock Holmes adventure <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075194?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Seven-Per-Cent Solution</a> (1976).<br><br>After a celebrated Broadway debut, she created further controversy in 1977 with her involvement in two films, firstly in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076245?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Julia</a> (1977) where she acted opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000404?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Jane Fonda</a> as a woman fighting Nazi oppression and narrated and featured in the documentary <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076521?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Palestinian</a> (1977) where she famously danced holding a Kalashnikov rifle. She publicly stated her condemnation of what she termed \"Zionist hudlums\", which outraged Jewish groups and as a result a screening of her documentary was bombed and Redgrave was personally threatened by the Jewish Defense League (JDL). <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076245?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Julia</a> (1977) happened to be a huge critical success and Redgrave herself was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but Jewish support groups demanded her nomination to be dropped and at the event of the Academy Awards burned effigies of Redgrave and protested and picketed. Redgrave was forced to enter the event via a rear entrance to avoid harm and when she won the award she famously remarked on the frenzy causes as \"Zionist hoodlums\" which caused the audience to audibly gasp and boo. The speech reached newspapers the next morning and her reputation was further damaged.<br><br>It came as a surprise when CBS hired her for the part of real life Nazi camp survivor Fania Fenelon in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081344?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Playing for Time</a> (1980), despite more controversy and protesting (Fenelon herself didn\'t even want Redgrave to portray her) she won an Emmy for the part and the film was one of the highest rating programs of the year. Her follow up film work to her Oscar had been mostly low key but successful, performances in films such as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080157?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Yanks</a> (1979), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078736?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Agatha</a> (1979), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086992?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Bostonians</a> (1984), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090310?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Wetherby</a> (1985) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093776?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Prick Up Your Ears</a> (1987) further cemented her reputation as a fine actress and she received various accolades and nominations.<br><br>However mainly in the 1980s, she focused on TV films and high budget mini-series as well as theatre in both London and New York. She made headlines in 1984 when she sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra for $5 million for wrongful cancellation of her contract because of her politics (she also stated her salary was significantly reduced in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078736?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Agatha</a> (1979) for the same reason). She became more mainstream in the 1990s where she appeared in a string of high profile films but the parts often underused Redgrave\'s abilities or they were small cameos/5-minute parts. Highlights included <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104454?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Howards End</a> (1992), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110365?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Little Odessa</a> (1994), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Mission: Impossible</a> (1996) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150216?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cradle Will Rock</a> (1999), as well as her leading lady parts in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113849?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Month by the Lake</a> (1995) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119723?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Mrs Dalloway</a> (1997).<br><br>In 2003 she finally won the coveted Tony award for her performance in \'The Long Day\'s Journey Into Night\' and followed up with another two Tony nominated performances on Broadway, her one woman show \'The Year of Magical Thinking\' in 2007 and \'Driving Miss Daisy\' in 2010 which not only was extended due to high demand, but was also transferred to the West End for an additional three months in 2011.<br><br>Vanessa continues to lend her name to causes and has been notable for donating huge amounts of her own money for her various beliefs. She has publicly opposed the war in Iraq, campaigned for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, supported the rights of gays and lesbians as well as AIDs research and many other issues. She released her autobiography in 1993 and a few years later she was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She also famously declined the invitation to be made a Dame for her services as an actress. Many have wondered the possible heights her career could have reached if it wasn\'t for her outspoken views, but being a celebrity and the artificial lifestyle usually attached doesn\'t seem to interest Redgrave in the slightest.<br><br>Vanessa has worked with all three of her children professionally on numerous occasions (her eldest daughter, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001670?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Natasha Richardson</a> tragically died at the age of 45 due to a skiing accident) and in her mid 70s she still works regularly on television, film and theatre, delivering time and time again great performances.<br>\n         ','1937-01-30 00:00:00',NULL,'Greenwich, London, England, UK','0000603','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MjE0OTgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3ODMwMg@@._V1_UY317_CR6,0,214,317_AL_.jpg',1545843479),(470,'Lois Robbins',NULL,'Lois Robbins is a native New Yorker and an accomplished actress.

Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts.<br><br>Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene K. (from Kassel), and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.<br><br>After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001732?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cybill Shepherd</a> in the hit romantic comedy television series <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088571?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Moonlighting</a> (1985).

This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis\' character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper.

The people decided to believe in him and give him an opportunity, especially thanks to the young boy\'s talents of persuasion and initiative. At the age of 16 he produced his first film, and after failing to distribute it in cinemas he invented a new distribution model, to which a name was also given: Cine School Day. The distribution strategy involved adding a film into the school curriculum, giving the opportunity to students, during school time, on payment of a reduced-price ticket, to go to the cinema in the morning and watch a film that would open the door for social debates. He therefore created a real library of films with strong social themes and proposed them to schools, complete with information brochures and ideas for debate. Sometimes, at screenings, actors and producers of the film also took part, driven by Andrea\'s enthusiasm. The initiative gained so much importance that even the senator for life Giulio Andreotti attended as spokesperson.

However, Laurie\'s big acting break came much earlier in her career, starring with Vanessa Redgrave in the critically acclaimed TNT mini-series Young Catherine. Since that auspicious beginning, she has appeared in several groundbreaking television series, including seminal roles on FOX\'s The X-Files, FX\'s The Shield, and currently FX\'s The Americans. Holden\'s big screen debut found her starring alongside Jim Carrey in Frank Darabont\'s The Majestic. The 1950\'s period piece earned Holden critical acclaim and a place on Entertainment Weekly\'s \"100 Most Creative People in Entertainment\" list and Variety\'s \"Ten Actors To Watch\" list. Laurie entered the comic book world when she co-starred opposite Michael Chiklis in Fox\'s Fantastic Four and then ventured into the gamer genre with her starring role as the iconic Cybil Bennett opposite Sean Bean in Christophe Gans\' cult horror classic Silent Hill. She also starred with Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden in Stephen King\'s sci-fi thriller The Mist and in the Farrelly Brothers\' Dumb and Dumber To with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. She will soon be seen in Adam MacDonald\'s Pyewacket with Nicole Munoz and will be voicing the role of \"Dakota\" in the animated feature Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad. In 2011, Holden received two Best Supporting Actress nominations for her work on The Walking Dead: one from Spike TV\'s Scream Awards and another from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films\' Saturn Awards. She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Walking Dead in 2013. Earlier in her career, she also received a Best Actress nomination from the Genie Awards (Canada\'s equivalent to the Emmys) for her guest- starring role on the Canadian comedy hit Due South. In 2014, Holden executive produced her first motion picture: Rebecca Johnson\'s critically acclaimed film Honeytrap, which garnered a nomination at the London Film Festival, received U.S distribution through Ava DuVernay\'s film collective ARRAY, and can currently be streamed on Netflix. Laurie is also an Executive Producer on The Time of Their Lives (Bright Pictures/Daryl Prince Productions) starring Dame Joan Collins, Pauline Collins, Franco Nero and Joely Richardson. The film will be distributed by Universal in most world markets, starting with its 2017 cinema release in the UK on March 10th. Holden is also a human rights activist, and dedicates much of her time and effort to enriching and protecting the lives of women and children victimized by the sex trade. Through her philanthropic work with Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery, she volunteered in the field in Cartagena, Colombia with O.U.R. on a mission that helped liberate 55 young sex slaves and brought down notorious sex trafficker Marcus Bronschidle. The successful sting operation was featured on ABC\'s Nightline and is the subject of an upcoming documentary entitled The Abolitionists. Holden serves on the Board of Alamasi Collaborative Arts, a Zimbabwean dramatic arts collaborative.

He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, \"The Goon Show,\" starring the legendary <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000634?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Peter Sellers</a>, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0589711?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Spike Milligan</a>, and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0781183?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Harry Secombe</a>.<br><br>Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university\'s legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001037?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Graham Chapman</a>. Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name \"Cambridge Circus.\" When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Terry Gilliam</a>, another future Python.<br><br>Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, \"I\'m Sorry, I\'ll Read That Again\", based on Cambridge Circus.

His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Irish, Scottish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father\'s oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.<br><br>He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145709?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Chicano Chariots</a> (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680364?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Don Phillips</a>, who introduced him to director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000500?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Richard Linklater</a> for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dazed and Confused</a> (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110978?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation</a> (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Renée Zellweger</a>.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116905?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lone Star</a> (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001300?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">John Grisham</a>\'s novel <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117913?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Time to Kill</a> (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Sandra Bullock</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000228?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Kevin Spacey</a>.

She is the daughter of acting coach Burton Eugene \"Burt\" Lane and nightclub singer/centerfold Colleen Farrington. Her parents\' families were both from the state of Georgia. Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six. Her work in such acclaimed theater productions as \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Medea\" led to her being called to Hollywood. She was 13 when she was cast by director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001351?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">George Roy Hill</a> in his wonderful 1979 film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079477?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Little Romance</a> (1979), opposite Sir <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000059?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Laurence Olivier</a>.

After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including \"Time\", which declared her the \"new young acting sensation\". However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081646?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Touched by Love</a> (1980), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082145?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cattle Annie and Little Britches</a> (1981), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082799?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Movie Madness</a> (1982), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082639?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains</a> (1982) and, most unmemorably, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084690?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Six Pack</a> (1982), all of which failed to set her career on fire.<br><br>She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Francis Ford Coppola</a> took note of Diane\'s appeal and cast her in two \"youth\"-oriented films based on <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386023?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">S.E. Hinton</a> novels. Indeed, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086216?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rumble Fish</a> (1983) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086066?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Outsiders</a> (1983) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088161?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Splash</a> (1984) (which was a surprise hit for <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000435?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Daryl Hannah</a>). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001353?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Walter Hill</a>\'s glossy rock \'n\' roll fable <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088194?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Streets of Fire</a> (1984) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087089?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Cotton Club</a> (1984) co-starring <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000152?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Richard Gere</a> was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn\'t. Possibly \"burned out\" by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she \"retired\" from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her \"retirement\" have since grown in popularity, and \"Streets of Fire\" especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn\'t get when it was first released.<br><br>The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093379?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lady Beware</a> (1987), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092656?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Big Town</a> (1987) with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000369?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Matt Dillon</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tommy Lee Jones</a>. In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn\'t until 1989\'s smash hit TV mini-series <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096639?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lonesome Dove</a> (1989) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable \"whore with a heart\" won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again.

He is of mixed ethnicity, with his mother Nicola, originating from Plymouth, Devon, England and his father Kofi, originally from Ghana, west Africa. Joey grew up and spent the first 10 years of his life in Streatham, South London, attending private school first at Oakfield School and then at Dulwich College Prep. During these early years in London, his interest and enjoyment for acting and performance became evident, as he took part in all of the stage performances that were on offer. The almost obsessive interest in martial arts and action cinema began very young. As early as Joey can recount, he has memories of his father renting Action and martial arts films from the local video shop which he would avidly watch. Arnold, Stallone, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Van Damme became instinctive idols and sources of inspiration which remain to this day. Joey\'s family then emigrated to Accra, Ghana. This was initially a culture shock to say the least for a young Joey, who had up to this point spent most of his life in the almost exclusively white, upper-middle class environment of the English public-school system. In Accra, Joey attended Ghana\'s top International school for almost 5 years. During this period he was able to truly get in touch with African culture, and obtain a balanced understanding, love and pride for both halves of his heritage. Acting and stage performance continued here for a time as well. It was in Ghana that Joey\'s love for martial arts, dancing and stunts really took off. He joined the local Tae Kwon Do class which he trained at for 4 years. He became embroiled in the Hip Hop dance craze that was present at the school in Ghana. He also fell in love with motorbikes and began riding with friends - including the sons of an Australian former motocross champion.<br><br>A few months before his 15th birthday, Joey moved back to England (this time to Plymouth) with his mother and 1-year old sister, Tanoa. He attended Devonport High school for boys where he completed his secondary education. During this time Joey also began obsessively training for the rare Martial art of Ninjutsu with military personnel in Plymouth. After a brief stint high diving, Joey became very interested in acrobatics and tumbling, and began to develop this aspect of Ninjutsu to a very high level. After passing his A-levels, Joey moved to Oxford where he did a 3 year degree in Human biology at Oxford Brookes University. Whilst continuing to practice Ninjutsu and Acrobatics, he also took up the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira in which he has trained ever since. It was during these 3 years in Oxford that Joey began his professional work in show-business, getting work and experience wherever he could. In the first couple of years at University, Joey did his fair share of extras and walk-on parts and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to spend lots of time on varied film, TV and commercial sets, learning the film making process and more importantly watching and intently studying established actors at work. Rather than frowning upon doing extras work as many do, he viewed this as an invaluable learning period. Joey also worked as a model, both on the catwalk and in TV and print campaigns. His work in stunts also occurred at this time, working on Batman Begins as a stuntman, in addition to working as trainer and fight choreographer on the Sci-Fi series Starhyke (2006).

The play was directed by Eric Ting and performed at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta. She loved getting to play the multidimensional character, Holly Lillian Eames, every night. The joy of playing this character was that she could not be deemed right or wrong, bur rather varying shades of gray, as the audience weighed whether Eames was virtuous or scandalous. Hood also loved her comedic role in Tyler Perry\'s \"Single Moms Club\' as it was one of her first major opportunities to fully improvise a comedic character in a film.<br><br>But there were twists and turns on Hood\'s road to being a professional actor. She enjoyed theater through high school, but the responsibilities of adulthood called by the time she was in college. Carrie decided to get a \"real job\" working at CNN upon her move to Atlanta. She quickly sought out theater opportunities and began performing weekly with a local improv troupe. The turning point to pursuing acting professionally would come years later, after reading a book called Dream Giver, by Bruce Wilkinson. Not long after hearing this author speak, Carrie took a giant leap of faith and quit her corporate job to become a full time actor... with no agent and a mortgage. But her driving force was her conviction that she had to give acting her all or risk leading an unfulfilled life. And that big risk had a big payoff. Six months later, she got an agent and booked her first commercial role. She also began working in production which eventually led to work as a producer. Carrie has been with the same agency, Houghton Talent, for over 10 years, enjoying both commercial and theatrical success as an actor. She is happily married with two young kids and works hard to balance family and work life, all of which bring her immeasurable joy.<br>\n         ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'0909508','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTcyOTQ0YzktY2E2Zi00NmU4LWJjM2EtZWI5ZDhmZjZkNDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg',1545843479),(1092,'Joanne Clendining',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4364014','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB470041852_.png',1545868802),(1093,'Tony Scott',NULL,'From Detroit Mi, Tony (Atlanta, The Front Runner, Into the Ashes, Gemini Man) is a Veteran US Army Ranger and Ranger school instructor for the Department of the Army.

Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago\'s Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rob Lowe</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000530?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Andrew McCarthy</a> in the romantic comedy <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085346?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Class</a> (1983). His next role, as a member of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Anthony Michael Hall</a>\'s geek brigade in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Sixteen Candles</a> (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090103?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Sure Thing</a> (1985) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088794?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Better Off Dead...</a> (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Say Anything...</a> (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099703?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Grifters</a> (1990).<br><br>The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000209?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tim Robbins</a>\' Actors\' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack\'s high school friends <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684336?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Steve Pink</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0222584?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">D.V. DeVincentis</a> joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime\'s first feature was the sharply written comedy <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Grosse Pointe Blank</a> (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (<a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000378?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Minnie Driver</a>). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film\'s financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack\'s next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118880?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Con Air</a> (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions.

Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000518?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">John Malkovich</a>. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">High Fidelity</a> (2000), another New Crime production.

After making a move to Maysville, Kentucky with her family, she began working at Straub Elementary school. She returned home to Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, where she lived most of her life, for her husband\'s career. She was happy to return home for her mother and father\'s sake but she noticed a change in the town after returning; the mom and pop shops she dearly loved closed. Lea wanted to make a difference and she started a network through Facebook to help her town. The network, LAWRENCEBURG, KENTUCKY COMMUNITY NETWORK, caught on fast in 2010 and grew. She also wanted to raise her two boys in a small town environment. Lea worked as a substitute teacher/assistant for 14 years in Lawrenceburg area and still substitutes when needed, today. Now that her youngest is attending Western Kentucky University majoring in Sports Broadcast and the oldest son has graduated from Western Kentucky University with a Civil Engineering Degree and is now pursuing his Masters in Structural Engineering, she decided to work in the film industry. While studying acting, she appeared on camera in her first movie, \"Hope Bridge\". Soon after, she began her work in Production and Acting, through the films, \"Faces,\" \"Bitter Sweet,\" \"In The Radiant City,\" \"JL Ranch,\" \"The Ultimate Legacy;\" - a Hallmark Mysteries and Movie Channel, and many short films such as \"Slipper Hero,\" \"The Exchange Program,\" \"Grace,\" \"Summerland,\" \"Crazy,\" \"The Cats Out of the Bag,\" etc.. throughout the state of Kentucky, she wanted to also pursue commercials and has appeared in them as well. She had her first lead roles as an actress in an Independent film called \"The Invasion of Kelly,\" as Ms. Gleanie, a short film called \"Grace\" as Grace and \"Slipper Hero,\" as Paulette Goofer.

Knowing how the group link LAWRENCEBURG, KENTUCKY COMMUNITY NETWORK caught on fast through Facebook, Lea wanted to help the Film Industry in Kentucky, therefore, she started her next group on Facebook called KENTUCKY FILMS, a network designed for communication regarding trailers, casting calls, crew availability, and a host of other communicative areas for film in her state. She is listed with the Kentucky Film Commission under Production Resources through the \"Search Directory,\" as a Production Assistant, Production Coordinator, and Production Secretary. Lea\'s goals are to become more involved in acting and production work in film hoping she can bring film to the central Kentucky area; especially her hometown of Lawrenceburg. If so, this will help maintain the mom and pop shops through tourism and keep the town alive as it was in the days when The Flim Flam Man movie starring George C.

Her father Peter Rowling was an engineer for Rolls Royce in Bristol at this time. Her mother, Anne, was half-French and half-Scottish. They met on a train as it left King\'s Cross Station in London. Her sister Diana is about 2 years younger than Joanne. In 1971, Peter Rowling moved his family to the nearby village of Winterbourne (still in the Bristol vicinity). During the family\'s residence in Winterbourne, Jo and Di Rowling were friends with neighborhood children, Ian and Vikki Potter. In 1974, the Rowling family moved yet again, this time to Tutshill, near the Welsh border-town of Chepstow in the Forest of Dean and across the Severn River from the greater Bristol area. Rowling admits to having been a bit of a daydreamer as a child and began writing stories at the age of six. After leaving Exeter University, where she read French and Classics, she started work as a teacher but daydreamed about becoming a writer. One day, stuck on a delayed train for four hours between Manchester and London, she dreamed up a boy called \"Harry Potter\". That was in 1990. It took her six years to write the book. In the meantime, she went to teach in Portugal, married a Portuguese television journalist, had her daughter, Jessica, divorced her husband and returned to Britain when Jessica was just three months old. She went to live in Edinburgh to be near her sister, Di. Her sudden penury made her realize that it was \"back-against-the-wall time\" and she decided to finish her \"Harry Potter\" book. She sent the manuscript to two agents and one publisher, looking up likely prospects in the library.

He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse\'s aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Irish, Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), and more distant French-Canadian, English, and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn\'t have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark\'s mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son\'s subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He\'d spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.<br><br>The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.<br><br>Around this time, his older brother <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Donnie Wahlberg</a> had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">New Kids on the Block</a>. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.<br><br>Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper\'s willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311691?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">David Geffen</a> saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0458681?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Calvin Klein</a>, Marky Mark was set up as the designer\'s chief underwear model.<br><br>His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578753?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">New Kids on the Block</a>\'s fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark\'s\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000187?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Madonna</a> and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1133072?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Shabba Ranks</a>, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.<br><br>Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Penny Marshall</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Renaissance Man</a> (1994). Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110971?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Renaissance Man</a> (1994), he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Basketball Diaries</a> (1995) and chilled them in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116287?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Fear</a> (1996) as every father\'s worst nightmare.<br><br>The major turning point in Wahlberg\'s career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Boogie Nights</a> (1997).

Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.<br><br>A turning point in Zimmer\'s career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001469?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Barry Levinson</a>.

Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I.

He was less impressive as the lead in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069761?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Badge 373</a> (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0250670?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Eddie Egan</a>, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as \"Popeye Doyle\" in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067116?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The French Connection</a> (1971).<br><br>It was his appearance as \"Lt.

He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\"<br><br>Subsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079239?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Great Santini</a> (1979) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086423?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tender Mercies</a> (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled \"Oscar curse\" that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0707023?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Luise Rainer</a>, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001768?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rod Steiger</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0731772?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cliff Robertson</a>. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Godfather: Part III</a> (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Al Pacino</a>, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone.<br><br>His greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096639?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lonesome Dove</a> (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination.

Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073885?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">We\'re Not the Jet Set</a> (1977), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085168?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Angelo My Love</a> (1983) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283897?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Assassination Tango</a> (2002).

Starring Farrell amongst a number of other budding young actors, the film portrays a group of new recruits being trained for the war in Vietnam. Farrell played the arrogant soldier Boz, drafted into the army and completely spiteful of authority. The film was praised by critics, but did not make much money at the box office. It was Farrell\'s first big role on film, and certainly not his last. Farrell followed up with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244000?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">American Outlaws</a> (2001), where he played the notorious outlaw Jesse James with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004790?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Scott Caan</a>, son of legendary actor <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001001?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">James Caan</a>, in the role of Cole Younger.

Farrell donned a blond wig and retained his Irish accent, and gave a fine performance as Alexander. However, both he and the film were criticized. Despite being one of the highest grossing films internationally and doing a good job at the DVD sales, Farrell did not come out of the experience without a few hurts. Farrell attempted to rebound with his historical film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402399?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The New World</a> (2005).

Mr. Bowman was blessed enough to publish his second novel \"I LOVE YOU\" through his own company in the spring of 2011. He is currently working on his third horror novel titled \"WET\".

Mr. Bowman found his love for acting by appearing in the following local stage plays: What Color is Trouble?, The Promise, The Bell Ringer, A Wing and a Prayer, Secrets of a Dark Skinned Sister, The Holy Shop and 1940s Radio Hour. This lead Mr. Bowman trying his hand at screen acting and to write, co-directed and star in MY BROTHER\'S KEEPER THE SERIES which is based off of the novel he wrote.

At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York\'s hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash.

He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001857?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Henry Winkler</a>, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071772?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Lords of Flatbush</a> (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000339?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Roger Corman</a>-produced <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072856?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Death Race 2000</a> (1975). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight title. <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rocky</a> (1976) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie franchises in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001735?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Talia Shire</a>, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580565?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Burgess Meredith</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949350?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Burt Young</a>, and director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000814?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">John G. Avildsen</a> gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood\'s hottest new star.<br><br>Stallone followed <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rocky</a> (1976) with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077531?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">F.I.S.T.</a> (1978), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078056?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Paradise Alley</a> (1978) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079817?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rocky II</a> (1979). The second outing for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn\'t as powerful or successful as the first \"Rocky\"; however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082817?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Nighthawks</a> (1981) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083284?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Victory</a> (1981) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084602?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rocky III</a> (1982) and a fearsome opponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001558?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Mr. T</a>. The third \"Rocky\" installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another mega-franchise was about to commence for the busy actor.<br><br>The character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of Canadian-born writer <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0606251?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">David Morrell</a>, and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083944?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">First Blood</a> (1982), also starring <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001077?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Richard Crenna</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001133?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Brian Dennehy</a>. The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public\'s psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089880?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rambo: First Blood Part II</a> (1985), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film\'s plotline about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John Rambo\'s\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan Drago\" played by curt <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000185?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dolph Lundgren</a> in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rocky IV</a> (1985). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001835?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Carl Weathers</a>, at the hands of the unstoppable \"Siberian Express\".<br><br>Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090859?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cobra</a> (1986) was a clumsy mess, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093692?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Over the Top</a> (1987) was equally mediocre, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095956?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rambo III</a> (1988) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098439?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tango &amp; Cash</a> (1989) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Kurt Russell</a>.<br><br>Philadelphia\'s favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100507?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rocky V</a> (1990) tackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607338?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tommy Morrison</a>, the great-nephew of screen legend <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000078?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">John Wayne</a>.

Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118887?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cop Land</a> (1997), also starring <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000501?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Ray Liotta</a>.

Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120587?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Antz</a> (1998), reprised the role made famous by <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Michael Caine</a> in a terrible remake of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208988?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Get Carter</a> (2000), climbed back into a race car for <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132245?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Driven</a> (2001), and guest-starred as the \"Toymaker\" in the third chapter of the immensely popular \"Spy Kids\" film series, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338459?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Spy Kids 3: Game Over</a> (2003).

When S.J. first got the chance to help out at the age of 7 on a short horror film, he was instantly hooked.

His interest grew so strong that most people around him didn\'t share the same passion, and it became hard to continue doing projects and taking them to higher levels. After awhile, when S.J. reached his teens, he was conditioned by everyone around him that making movies was nothing but a dream. It was something that could never be possible. He was taught, that where he came from, he had to go out and get a job with the mentality to conform to the norm and be happy with just a decent paycheck.<br><br>Years went by and S.J. bought some sound recording equipment as a side hobby. He built a bedroom studio and had some major radio success with his personal projects. S.J. liked it but he wasn\'t fulfilled.

And so the long lost acting desire was re-awakened and in 2018 Michael submitted for Creed 2 and was cast as a Russian Military Officer, escorting the Drago Entourage and performing security in the Drago corner. Also in 2018 Michael was cast in two roles in Miss Atkins Army, a WWII period piece, first as a OSS Officer (pre-sursor to the CIA), and then as a Officer in The British Royal Air Force.

Her stage name was Yuuki Chiho. Years later she would relay that she only started acting for the money. Her father had wanted her to become a pharmacologist, but she missed her examination due to a fractured foot. She changed her alias to Kirin Kiki after being asked to auction something on a television show claiming she possessed nothing else she could offer. Her marriage to fellow trouper Kishida Shin came to an end after four years in 1968. She married pop musician Uchida Yuya in 1973. The couple quickly raised eyebrows by opting to live under separate roofs. They had a daughter. They are separated today. Her daughter, Uchida Yayako, portrayed the younger character of Kiki\'s in Tokyo Tower: Mom And Me, And Sometimes Dad. Uchida Yayako is married to the actor Motoki Masahiro of Departures fame. Kirin\'s granddaughter acted alongside her in Red Bean. Uchida Yayako lives in Great Britain. Kirin appeared in many television serials, feature films and inevitably commercials like the Tora-San series, the offbeat Pistol Opera, Tokyo Tower: Mom And Me, And Sometimes Dad and the dismal Red Beans by which time she was very well-known. She has focused on the big screen, instead of television, in recent years. Heartache struck successively in 2003 and 2004 when she had to contend with a detached retina in her left eye, which made her believe she would go blind, and breast cancer which later - as of 2017 - would be announced incurable and terminal. She wanted people to know she undergone a mastec-tomy following her breast cancer diagnosis. Kirin won the Best Supporting Actress award at the Yokohama Film Festival for her work in the comedy Kamikaze Girls and Half A Confession in 2004 and the Japan Academy Prize for Mom And Me, And Sometimes Dad for Best Actress in 2008. She reports that she is a preferred recluse who does not like children and preferably does not interact with her own child or grandchild.

His early interest in language made him start writing from a very early age, and never stopped. Normelli went to acting school during his high school years in Gothenburg. After graduation and a couple of years of working in a record store, he got bored of Gothenburg and went to Seattle, WA where he studied English, sang with The Total Experience Gospel Choir and fell in love with the city itself. During 2002 through 2007, Normelli went back and forth between Seattle WA, Fresno CA, Brighton UK and his native Gothenburg. Besides a four-months acting course in Brighton (where he studied literature/linguistics), the main passion was writing. Once back on Swedish soil, Normelli wrote poems, pop songs and started working on a novel. In 2014, after a long and stressful separation, he finally went back to acting in the form of improvise under the guidance of acting coach John Pekkari at Improverket. The passion came back quickly and strongly. His first experience on set was as an extra in the biopic \"Borg vs McEnroe\" (starring Shia LaBeouf etc.) where he got to know the casting director Fredrik Fornänger. The experience of being part of a feature film became the starting point of an exponentially growing career. Over the period of less than two years, Normelli went on to be a part of handful movies, a dozen short films, three commercials, two TV-series and a seven-months theater play. In the summer of 2018, Normelli will be publishing a collection of Swedish texts on the theme of relationships as well as doing a couple of big name movies. In July, he will participate in workshops in a renowned acting studio in Los Angeles.
