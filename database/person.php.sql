She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole\'s father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents\' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole\'s first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001005?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Jane Campion</a> (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085282?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Bush Christmas</a> (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085204?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">BMX Bandits</a> (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140770?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Vietnam</a> (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000554?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Sam Neill</a> in the at-sea thriller <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097162?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dead Calm</a> (1989).<br><br>Kidman\'s next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tom Cruise</a>\'s doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099371?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Days of Thunder</a> (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101898?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Flirting</a> (1991), then as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dustin Hoffman</a>\'s moll in the gangster flick <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101453?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Billy Bathgate</a> (1991). She reunited with Cruise for <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104231?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Far and Away</a> (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Michael Keaton</a> in the tear-tugger <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107630?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">My Life</a> (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000174?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Val Kilmer</a> in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Batman Forever</a> (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001814?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Gus Van Sant</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114681?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">To Die For</a> (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics\' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001005?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Jane Campion</a>, on the adaptation of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416556?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Henry James</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117364?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Portrait of a Lady</a> (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119874?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Peacemaker</a> (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.<br><br>She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Stanley Kubrick</a>\'s sexual thriller <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> (1999). The couple\'s on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise\'s homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1159418?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Antonia Kidman</a>, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents\' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts.

Mark was very athletic in school, however, after a sports injury sidelined his sports career he became very interested in the arts. He developed his artistic side painting in acrylics, watercolors, pen and ink, oils, winning several local juried art shows. At the same time, he was also writing short stories and experimenting with acting and the inner workings of the movie industry. Mark graduated from Penn State and worked in radio - selling advertising, doing voice-overs and writing copy. He also began his modeling career in print and local television commercials. Shortly thereafter, he was accepted into law school and three years later graduated from Ohio Northern Law School. While attending law school, Mark was hired by the theater department to develop campaigns, and promote and advertise theatrical productions. He was also the house manager and became a mainstay in the theater department. law, he continued to write copy and announce sporting events on the radio for his father at night. Mark was also very involved in the community, coaching several sports and volunteering for several organizations. He was chairman of the Young Lawyers Division of the local bar association. During this time, Mark used his expertise in broadcasting, media and his coaching skills and applied everything to the organizations he was involved in, but mostly toward his bar association duties. In 2001-2002, all of Mark\'s efforts came together when he created a program called \"Legal Eagles.\" The program, which brought professionals from various fields into the school districts to speak with the students, became recognized locally, by the state and nationally earning him accolades from various governors of Pennsylvania and two former U.S. presidents (Clinton and Bush). The American Bar Association ranked the program in the top 10 of public service programs in the 50 states in all U.S. Territories. The program continues today but on a limited basis due to Mark investing more time into his creative ventures - photography for the local newspaper, acting (locally and throughout the mid-Atlantic states), working as an extra in educational films, feature films and made-for-TV movies.

But a friend suggested that, with his flair for the dramatic, he consider a career in acting. Throughout the 1970s, he divided his time between rock music gigs, acting classes, bit parts in television, Off-off-off Broadway plays and his business of moving fine furniture (which kept body, soul and family together).

But acting, directing and screenwriting are only parts of what he does. Olmos contends he would much rather be known as an activist than an actor. He devotes much of his time to causes, particularly those focusing on the needs and rights of children. He makes, on average, some 150 personal appearances a year to places where he can reach kids at risk; juvenile halls, detention centers, boys/girls clubs, schools.

He is the son of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852983?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Patricia Taylor</a>, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu\'s mother is originally from England. After his parents\' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716238?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Kim Reeves</a>, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007477?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Paul Aaron</a>, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.<br><br>After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rob Lowe</a> hockey flick <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092272?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Youngblood</a> (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics\' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">River\'s Edge</a> (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> (1988) with director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001241?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Stephen Frears</a>.<br><br>His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude \"Ted Logan\" in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Bill &amp; Ted\'s Excellent Adventure</a> (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000165?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Ron Howard</a>\'s comedy, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098067?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Parenthood</a> (1989) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001410?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lawrence Kasdan</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099819?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">I Love You to Death</a> (1990).<br><br>Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000203?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">River Phoenix</a>\'s narcoleptic male hustler in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">My Own Private Idaho</a> (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire\'s lair in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103874?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Bram Stoker\'s Dracula</a> (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Much Ado About Nothing</a> (1993).<br><br>In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Speed</a> (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116289?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Feeling Minnesota</a> (1996) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119502?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Last Time I Committed Suicide</a> (1997), and big films like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Walk in the Clouds</a> (1995) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Devil\'s Advocate</a> (1997).

In 2009, Emily\'s venture into television began when she became a popular face, recurring as \'Emily Gardener\' on the ABC series \"Eastwick\" and on the daytime drama \"All My Children\" as \'Emma Lavery.\' She continued to be seen on hit television series such as \"Medium,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Hawaii 5-O,\" \"Suburgatory,\" Lifetime\'s \"Who is Clark Rockefeller?\", and \"Sundays at Tiffany\'s.\" She is also widely known for the ABC hit series, \"Revenge,\" playing \'Young Amanda Clarke.\' In 2011, Emily was given the amazing opportunity to play Shirley Temple in Clint Eastwood\'s \"J.

And in 2012, she had two films premiere; the thriller, \"The Haunting in Connecticut 2,\" playing the lead role of \'Heidi,\' and \"Won\'t Back Down,\" playing \'Malia Fitzpatrick,\' a young girl struggling with dyslexia where she starred opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal. Following, Emily starred in the movie musical \"Dear Dumb Diary,\" playing the lead role of \'Jamie Kelly,\' based on the popular children\'s book series. Alongside the release of the critically acclaimed film, her soundtrack for the film is currently available on iTunes. One of her favorite projects was Venice Film Festival\'s \"Jackie and Ryan\" (2014), co- starring Katherine Heigl and Ben Barnes, where she was able to once again show off her musical skills. From there, she went straight into production on the Warner Brothers thriller, \"Hidden\" (2015), where she takes on the challenging role of a young girl surviving underground, co-starring alongside Alexander Skarsgard and Andrea Riseborough. Along with working on the ABC pilot \"Code Black\" and the comedy/action series for CBS, \"Rush Hour\", Emily has just completed production on the New Line horror film, \"Lights Out\", playing \'Sophie\' (a young Maria Bello) and the highly anticipated New Line feature comedy/horror film \"The Babysitter\" directed by McG and playing the lead love interest, \'Melanie\'.

A movie called \'Silent Tongue,\' by Sam Shepard, came to Roswell to film in the desert surrounding her home town. As a request of her mother\'s first time position as the on set tutor, Merritt auditioned for Sam Shepard as a featured, recurring, background player. \"I wanted to give Merritt an outlet for her strong tendencies toward performance that she showed since, well, pretty much birth,\" chuckles her mom. \"I knew this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for her, especially in a small town like Roswell.\" From this experience, Glover learned that her talent in performance could become the pursuit of a lifetime, and her career. Merritt begged her parents to travel to L.A. soon after \'Silent Tongue\' wrapped, but they both agreed that she needed to have a childhood, and a real life first. From that moment forward, Merritt took part in anything that had to do with acting. She vigorously sought out classes, community theatre, high school theatre, independent films, and eventually a college degree in Performing Arts. After graduating college as magna cum laude, Merritt went to Portland, Oregon to try on a different market in acting. With many successes in community and professional theatre (including one of her favorite roles, The Wicked Witch of the West), Merritt spent three years away from her home state. When asked what brought her back to New Mexico, Merritt states with a grin: \"The pilot of \'Breaking Bad\'....I was watching it in Portland and going, what the hell are you doing Merritt?! This is HUGE and it\'s going on right in your backyard! I knew I had to make it back to New Mexico to try and become a part of this incredible show in some way.

Soon to follow was another role on the well received show: \'Longmire\' as the Receptionist.

He traveled to Dublin to meet with director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001403?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Neil Jordan</a> and successfully won the role of Collins\'s assassin.

Three quarters of a century after her birth (despite numerous ups and down) this rather forward expectation has definitely been lived up to with an acclaimed actress that has won (among many others) an Academy Award, two Emmys, two Golden Globes, two Cannes Best Actress awards, a Tony, a Screen Actors Guild award, a Laurence Olivier theatre award and a BAFTA fellowship.<br><br>Growing up with such celebrated theatrical parents, great expectations were put on both herself, her brother <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714874?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Corin Redgrave</a> and sister <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001655?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lynn Redgrave</a> at an early age. Shooting up early and finally reaching a height just short of 6 foot, Redgrave initially had plans to dance and perform ballet as a profession. However she settled on acting and entered the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1954 and four years later made her West End debut. In the decade of the 1960s she developed and progressed to become one of the most noted young stars of the English stage and then film. Performances on the London stage included the classics: \'A Touch of Sun\', \'Coriolanus\', \'A Midsummer\'s Night Dream\', \'All\'s Well that Ends Well\', \'As You Like It\', \'The Lady from the Sea\', \'The Seagull\' and many others. By the mid 1960s, she had booked various film roles and matured into a striking beauty with a slim, tall frame and attractive face. In 1966 she made her big screen debut as the beautiful ex-wife of a madman in an Oscar nominated performance in the oddball comedy <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060714?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Morgan!</a> (1966), as well as the enigmatic woman in a public park in desperate need of a photographer\'s negatives in the iconic <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060176?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Blow-Up</a> (1966) and briefly appeared in an unspoken part of Anne Boleyn in the Best Picture winner of the year <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Man for All Seasons</a> (1966).<br><br>She managed to originate the title role in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" the same year on the London stage (which was then adapted for the big screen a few years later, but <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001749?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Maggie Smith</a> was cast instead and managed to win an Oscar for her performance). Her follow up work saw her play the lead in the box office hit adaptation <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061439?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Camelot</a> (1967), a film popular with audiences but dismissed by critics, and her second Academy Award nominated performance as Isadora Duncan in the critically praised <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063141?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Isadora</a> (1968).<br><br>Her rise in popularity on film also coincided with her public political involvement, she was one of the lead faces in protesting against the Vietnam war and lead a famous march on the US embassy, was arrested during a Ban-the-Bomb demonstration, publicly supported Yasar Arafat\'s Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and fought for various other human rights and particularly left wing causes. Despite her admirably independent qualities, most of her political beliefs weren\'t largely supported by the public. In 1971 after 3 films back to back, Redgrave suffered a miscarriage (it would have been her fourth, after <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001670?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Natasha Richardson</a>, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000613?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Joely Richardson</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0626254?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Carlo Gabriel Nero</a>) and a break up with her then partner and father of her son, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0626259?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Franco Nero</a>. This was around the same time her equally political brother Corin introduced her to the Workers Revolutionary Party, a group who aimed to destroy capitalism and abolish the monarchy. Her film career began to suffer and take the back seat as she became more involved with the party, twice unsuccessfully attempting to run as a party member for parliament, only obtaining a very small percentage of votes.<br><br>In terms of her film career at the time, she was given probably the smallest part in the huge ensemble who-dunnit hit, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071877?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Murder on the Orient Express</a> (1974) and given another thankless small part as Lola Deveraux in the Sherlock Holmes adventure <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075194?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Seven-Per-Cent Solution</a> (1976).<br><br>After a celebrated Broadway debut, she created further controversy in 1977 with her involvement in two films, firstly in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076245?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Julia</a> (1977) where she acted opposite <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000404?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Jane Fonda</a> as a woman fighting Nazi oppression and narrated and featured in the documentary <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076521?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Palestinian</a> (1977) where she famously danced holding a Kalashnikov rifle. She publicly stated her condemnation of what she termed \"Zionist hudlums\", which outraged Jewish groups and as a result a screening of her documentary was bombed and Redgrave was personally threatened by the Jewish Defense League (JDL). <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076245?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Julia</a> (1977) happened to be a huge critical success and Redgrave herself was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but Jewish support groups demanded her nomination to be dropped and at the event of the Academy Awards burned effigies of Redgrave and protested and picketed. Redgrave was forced to enter the event via a rear entrance to avoid harm and when she won the award she famously remarked on the frenzy causes as \"Zionist hoodlums\" which caused the audience to audibly gasp and boo. The speech reached newspapers the next morning and her reputation was further damaged.<br><br>It came as a surprise when CBS hired her for the part of real life Nazi camp survivor Fania Fenelon in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081344?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Playing for Time</a> (1980), despite more controversy and protesting (Fenelon herself didn\'t even want Redgrave to portray her) she won an Emmy for the part and the film was one of the highest rating programs of the year. Her follow up film work to her Oscar had been mostly low key but successful, performances in films such as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080157?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Yanks</a> (1979), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078736?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Agatha</a> (1979), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086992?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Bostonians</a> (1984), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090310?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Wetherby</a> (1985) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093776?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Prick Up Your Ears</a> (1987) further cemented her reputation as a fine actress and she received various accolades and nominations.<br><br>However mainly in the 1980s, she focused on TV films and high budget mini-series as well as theatre in both London and New York. She made headlines in 1984 when she sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra for $5 million for wrongful cancellation of her contract because of her politics (she also stated her salary was significantly reduced in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078736?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Agatha</a> (1979) for the same reason). She became more mainstream in the 1990s where she appeared in a string of high profile films but the parts often underused Redgrave\'s abilities or they were small cameos/5-minute parts. Highlights included <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104454?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Howards End</a> (1992), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110365?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Little Odessa</a> (1994), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Mission: Impossible</a> (1996) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150216?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cradle Will Rock</a> (1999), as well as her leading lady parts in <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113849?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Month by the Lake</a> (1995) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119723?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Mrs Dalloway</a> (1997).<br><br>In 2003 she finally won the coveted Tony award for her performance in \'The Long Day\'s Journey Into Night\' and followed up with another two Tony nominated performances on Broadway, her one woman show \'The Year of Magical Thinking\' in 2007 and \'Driving Miss Daisy\' in 2010 which not only was extended due to high demand, but was also transferred to the West End for an additional three months in 2011.<br><br>Vanessa continues to lend her name to causes and has been notable for donating huge amounts of her own money for her various beliefs. She has publicly opposed the war in Iraq, campaigned for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, supported the rights of gays and lesbians as well as AIDs research and many other issues. She released her autobiography in 1993 and a few years later she was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She also famously declined the invitation to be made a Dame for her services as an actress. Many have wondered the possible heights her career could have reached if it wasn\'t for her outspoken views, but being a celebrity and the artificial lifestyle usually attached doesn\'t seem to interest Redgrave in the slightest.<br><br>Vanessa has worked with all three of her children professionally on numerous occasions (her eldest daughter, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001670?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Natasha Richardson</a> tragically died at the age of 45 due to a skiing accident) and in her mid 70s she still works regularly on television, film and theatre, delivering time and time again great performances.<br>\n         ','1937-01-30 00:00:00',NULL,'Greenwich, London, England, UK','0000603','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MjE0OTgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3ODMwMg@@._V1_UY317_CR6,0,214,317_AL_.jpg',1545843479),(470,'Lois Robbins',NULL,'Lois Robbins is a native New Yorker and an accomplished actress.

Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts.<br><br>Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene K. (from Kassel), and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.<br><br>After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001732?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cybill Shepherd</a> in the hit romantic comedy television series <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088571?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Moonlighting</a> (1985).

This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis\' character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper.

However, Laurie\'s big acting break came much earlier in her career, starring with Vanessa Redgrave in the critically acclaimed TNT mini-series Young Catherine. Since that auspicious beginning, she has appeared in several groundbreaking television series, including seminal roles on FOX\'s The X-Files, FX\'s The Shield, and currently FX\'s The Americans. Holden\'s big screen debut found her starring alongside Jim Carrey in Frank Darabont\'s The Majestic. The 1950\'s period piece earned Holden critical acclaim and a place on Entertainment Weekly\'s \"100 Most Creative People in Entertainment\" list and Variety\'s \"Ten Actors To Watch\" list. Laurie entered the comic book world when she co-starred opposite Michael Chiklis in Fox\'s Fantastic Four and then ventured into the gamer genre with her starring role as the iconic Cybil Bennett opposite Sean Bean in Christophe Gans\' cult horror classic Silent Hill. She also starred with Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden in Stephen King\'s sci-fi thriller The Mist and in the Farrelly Brothers\' Dumb and Dumber To with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. She will soon be seen in Adam MacDonald\'s Pyewacket with Nicole Munoz and will be voicing the role of \"Dakota\" in the animated feature Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad. In 2011, Holden received two Best Supporting Actress nominations for her work on The Walking Dead: one from Spike TV\'s Scream Awards and another from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films\' Saturn Awards. She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Walking Dead in 2013. Earlier in her career, she also received a Best Actress nomination from the Genie Awards (Canada\'s equivalent to the Emmys) for her guest- starring role on the Canadian comedy hit Due South. In 2014, Holden executive produced her first motion picture: Rebecca Johnson\'s critically acclaimed film Honeytrap, which garnered a nomination at the London Film Festival, received U.S distribution through Ava DuVernay\'s film collective ARRAY, and can currently be streamed on Netflix. Laurie is also an Executive Producer on The Time of Their Lives (Bright Pictures/Daryl Prince Productions) starring Dame Joan Collins, Pauline Collins, Franco Nero and Joely Richardson. The film will be distributed by Universal in most world markets, starting with its 2017 cinema release in the UK on March 10th. Holden is also a human rights activist, and dedicates much of her time and effort to enriching and protecting the lives of women and children victimized by the sex trade. Through her philanthropic work with Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery, she volunteered in the field in Cartagena, Colombia with O.U.R. on a mission that helped liberate 55 young sex slaves and brought down notorious sex trafficker Marcus Bronschidle. The successful sting operation was featured on ABC\'s Nightline and is the subject of an upcoming documentary entitled The Abolitionists. Holden serves on the Board of Alamasi Collaborative Arts, a Zimbabwean dramatic arts collaborative.

His visceral depiction of these individuals captivates audiences and empowers him to steal scenes in many of his films, even when playing a minor role.

She is the daughter of acting coach Burton Eugene \"Burt\" Lane and nightclub singer/centerfold Colleen Farrington. Her parents\' families were both from the state of Georgia. Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six. Her work in such acclaimed theater productions as \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Medea\" led to her being called to Hollywood. She was 13 when she was cast by director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001351?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">George Roy Hill</a> in his wonderful 1979 film <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079477?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">A Little Romance</a> (1979), opposite Sir <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000059?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Laurence Olivier</a>. The film only did so-so commercially, but Olivier praised his young co-star, calling her the new <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000038?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Grace Kelly</a>. After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including \"Time\", which declared her the \"new young acting sensation\". However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081646?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Touched by Love</a> (1980), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082145?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Cattle Annie and Little Britches</a> (1981), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082799?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Movie Madness</a> (1982), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082639?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains</a> (1982) and, most unmemorably, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084690?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Six Pack</a> (1982), all of which failed to set her career on fire.<br><br>She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Francis Ford Coppola</a> took note of Diane\'s appeal and cast her in two \"youth\"-oriented films based on <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386023?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">S.E. Hinton</a> novels. Indeed, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086216?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Rumble Fish</a> (1983) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086066?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Outsiders</a> (1983) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088161?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Splash</a> (1984) (which was a surprise hit for <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000435?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Daryl Hannah</a>). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001353?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Walter Hill</a>\'s glossy rock \'n\' roll fable <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088194?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Streets of Fire</a> (1984) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087089?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Cotton Club</a> (1984) co-starring <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000152?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Richard Gere</a> was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn\'t. Possibly \"burned out\" by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she \"retired\" from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her \"retirement\" have since grown in popularity, and \"Streets of Fire\" especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn\'t get when it was first released.<br><br>The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093379?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lady Beware</a> (1987), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092656?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Big Town</a> (1987) with <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000369?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Matt Dillon</a> and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Tommy Lee Jones</a>. In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn\'t until 1989\'s smash hit TV mini-series <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096639?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Lonesome Dove</a> (1989) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable \"whore with a heart\" won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again. Another well-received TV production, <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099405?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Descending Angel</a> (1990), was followed by smaller roles in major films like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000277?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Richard Attenborough</a>\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103939?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Chaplin</a> (1992) and Mike Binder\'s <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107212?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Indian Summer</a> (1993), and larger parts in small independent films like <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104954?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">My New Gun</a> (1992), <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100879?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Vital Signs</a> (1990) and <a href=\"https://nullrefer.com/?https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104627?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Knight Moves</a> (1992).

He is of mixed ethnicity, with his mother Nicola, originating from Plymouth, Devon, England and his father Kofi, originally from Ghana, west Africa. Joey grew up and spent the first 10 years of his life in Streatham, South London, attending private school first at Oakfield School and then at Dulwich College Prep. During these early years in London, his interest and enjoyment for acting and performance became evident, as he took part in all of the stage performances that were on offer. The almost obsessive interest in martial arts and action cinema began very young. As early as Joey can recount, he has memories of his father renting Action and martial arts films from the local video shop which he would avidly watch. Arnold, Stallone, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Van Damme became instinctive idols and sources of inspiration which remain to this day. Joey\'s family then emigrated to Accra, Ghana. This was initially a culture shock to say the least for a young Joey, who had up to this point spent most of his life in the almost exclusively white, upper-middle class environment of the English public-school system. In Accra, Joey attended Ghana\'s top International school for almost 5 years. During this period he was able to truly get in touch with African culture, and obtain a balanced understanding, love and pride for both halves of his heritage. Acting and stage performance continued here for a time as well. It was in Ghana that Joey\'s love for martial arts, dancing and stunts really took off. He joined the local Tae Kwon Do class which he trained at for 4 years. He became embroiled in the Hip Hop dance craze that was present at the school in Ghana. He also fell in love with motorbikes and began riding with friends - including the sons of an Australian former motocross champion.<br><br>A few months before his 15th birthday, Joey moved back to England (this time to Plymouth) with his mother and 1-year old sister, Tanoa. He attended Devonport High school for boys where he completed his secondary education. During this time Joey also began obsessively training for the rare Martial art of Ninjutsu with military personnel in Plymouth. After a brief stint high diving, Joey became very interested in acrobatics and tumbling, and began to develop this aspect of Ninjutsu to a very high level. After passing his A-levels, Joey moved to Oxford where he did a 3 year degree in Human biology at Oxford Brookes University. Whilst continuing to practice Ninjutsu and Acrobatics, he also took up the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira in which he has trained ever since. It was during these 3 years in Oxford that Joey began his professional work in show-business, getting work and experience wherever he could. In the first couple of years at University, Joey did his fair share of extras and walk-on parts and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to spend lots of time on varied film, TV and commercial sets, learning the film making process and more importantly watching and intently studying established actors at work. Rather than frowning upon doing extras work as many do, he viewed this as an invaluable learning period. Joey also worked as a model, both on the catwalk and in TV and print campaigns. His work in stunts also occurred at this time, working on Batman Begins as a stuntman, in addition to working as trainer and fight choreographer on the Sci-Fi series Starhyke (2006). He has used his Dance, martial arts and acrobatic abilities for various music videos and Live international shows.<br><br>Straight after graduating from University, Joey moved back to London and landed a major role in the award winning UK indie film, Lovestruck (2005). Following that he got an acting agent and his full time acting career began. Over the last 2 years he has been working consistently in a varied range of TV and film projects. With notable TV appearances as the terrorist Abbud in the hit TV show Spooks (2005) (aka MI5 in the USA), Roman emperor Geta in the prime time BBC docuseries Timewatch (2006). In 2006 Joey landed a major role in the upcoming, ground breaking UK action Feature \'Underground\'.<br><br>His big Hollywood break came in the form of him being cast in the upcoming Bourne Ultimatum (2007) by award-winning director, Paul Greengrass, in which he plays \'Desh\', a Blackbriar super assassin working for the CIA who goes up against Jason Bourne (Matt Damon).

After finishing his studies in 1981, he plays at theaters in Magdeburg and in Anklam. There he joins Frank Castorf\'s ensemble, which is dismissed in 1982 for not conforming to East Germany\'s cultural policy. In 1984 Marx applies for permission to leave the country. He is put to jail and, after some months of imprisonment, is expelled to West Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1988 Marx plays at the theater in Basel, in between making his first movie appearance in Jeanine Meerapfel\'s \'Die Verliebten\'. In 1987 he plays the male lead in Robert van Ackeren\'s film \'Die Venusfalle\', and for this performance is awarded the Max Ophüls Prize as best young actor in 1989. In the early nineties Marx plays in TV productions a lot, e.g. in \'Die Tote von Amelung\' and in \'Mörderische Zwillinge\', though without completely abandoning to work on stage. He tours with Schiller\'s \'Die Räuber\', plays at the theater in Düsseldorf and at Berlin\'s Volksbühne. After 1996 Marx increasingly appears in TV serials, e.g. in \'Die Drei\', \'Tatort\', \'Balko, der Clown\', and \'SoKo 5113\'. In 2000 he plays the main role in the TV movie \'Die Wunde\'. In \'Dark Blue World\' he plays a sergeant for cinema, and in the cinema feature \'Freie Tanke\' (2000) he is one of the leads.
